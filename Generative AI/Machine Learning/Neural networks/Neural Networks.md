- A neural network machine learning program, or model, that makes decisions in a manner similar to the human brain, by using processes that mimic the way biological neurons work together to identify phenomena, weigh options and arrive at conclusions.
- ==Modeled after human brain structure and function==
- A neural network consists of interconnected layers of nodes (analogous to neurons) that work together to process and analyze complex data
-  Neural networks are well suited to tasks that involve identifying complex patterns and relationships in large amounts of data.
- Every neural network consists of layers of nodes or artificial neurons, an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. 
- Each node connects to others, and has its own associated weight and threshold. 
- If the output of any individual node is above the specified threshold value, that node is activated, sending data to the next layer of the network. Otherwise, no data is passed along to the next layer of the network.

- Neural networks rely on training data to learn and improve their accuracy over time. 
- Once they are fine-tuned for accuracy, they are powerful tools in computer science and AI allowing us to classify and cluster data at a high velocity. 
- Tasks in speech recognition or image recognition can take minutes versus hours when compared to the manual identification by human experts. 
- One of the best-known examples of a neural network is Google’s search algorithm.
- Neural networks are sometimes called artificial neural networks (ANNs) or simulated neural networks (SNNs). 
- They are a subset of machine learning, and at the heart of [deep learning](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/deep-learning) models.
## Types of neural networks

- Feedforward neural networks
- Convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
- Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) 
## Neural networks vs deep learning
- Deep Learning and neural networks tend to be used interchangeably in conversation, which can be confusing. 
- “deep” in deep learning is just referring to the depth of layers in a neural network. 
	- A neural network that consists of more than three layers, which would be inclusive of the inputs and the output, can be considered a deep learning algorithm. 
	- A neural network that only has two or three layers is just a basic neural network.
