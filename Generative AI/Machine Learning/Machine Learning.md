It is branch of Artificial Intelligence focused on enabling machine and computers to
		- Intimate the way the humans learn
		- perform tasks autonomously
		- improve their performances and accuracy through
			- learning and experience 
			- exposure to more data
- Parts of machine learning algorithms
	- Decision making
		- makes a prediction or classification
		- Based on labeled or un-labeled training data, algorithms predicts the patterns in the input data
	- Error function
		- Evaluates the prediction of model
		- asses the accuracy of model
	- Model optimization process
		- if prediction is fits to training data it adjust the weightages to improve the accuracy
		- Algorithms will repeat this evaluate and optimize approach until threshold of accuracy is met.

	## - Types of  ML algorithms
	- each of these approaches is suited to different kinds of problems and data.
		- [linear regression](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/linear-regression)
		- [logistic regression](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/logistic-regression)
		- [decision trees](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/decision-trees)
		- [random forest](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/random-forest)
		- [support vector machines](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/support-vector-machine) [(SVMs)](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/support-vector-machine)
		- [k-nearest neighbor (KNN),](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/knn)
		- [clustering](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/clustering) and 
		- more
		- ==One of the popular ML algorithms is Neural networks (artificial neural network)==
	## - Types of ML
	- Supervised learning
		- Simplest form of ML
		- use of labeled data set to train the algorithm to predict or classify the input accurately
		- Human pair training example with an output label
		- Model learn the relation between training data and label 
		- Then model predicts the new labels for unseen data
	- Un supervised learning
		- algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled data sets. 
		- discover hidden patterns or data groupings without the need for human intervention.
		- Unsupervised learning's ability to discover similarities and differences in information.
		- ideal solution for 
			- exploratory data analysis
			- cross-selling strategies
			- customer segmentation
			- image recognition.
	- Semi-supervised learning
	- Reinforcement learning
