- Technology that enables the machine and computers to
	- simulate human intelligence
	- comprehension
	- problem solving
	- decision making
	- creativity 
	- autonomy
	Examples
		- Applications equipped with AI can
			- Identify objects
			- Understands and respond in human languages
			- Learn from new information and experience
			- act independently (self-driving car)

The latest trends in AI is technology called Generative AI or GenAI which can 
		==- Generate original texts==
		==- Images==
		==- Videos== 
		==- Software codes==
		==- responds to user prompts or requests== 
	To fully understand GenAI first we need to understand the technologies on which GenAI is built
			- [[Machine Learning]] (ML)
			- Deep Learning (DL)
- - [[Artificial Intelligence]]e Vs [[Machine Learning]] Vs [[Deep Learning]] Vs [[Neural Networks]]
	- All there are sub-fields of [[Artificial Intelligence]]
	- Deep Learning and Neural Networks are sub-fields of Machine learning
	- Deep learning is sub-field of Neural networks
